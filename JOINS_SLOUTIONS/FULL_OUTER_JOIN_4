Q .Full Outer Join:Fetch all records from both the "students" and "grades" tables, displaying student names and their grades if available. If a student has no grade, display "Not Graded".
Ans .  Full Outer Join combines the results of both Left Join and Right Join. 
It returns all records from both tables and matches records where possible.
If there's no match, the result will include NULL values for the columns where there is no corresponding data from the other table.

5	                     C

QUERY : 
SELECT s.StudentName, COALESCE(g.Grade, 'Not Graded') AS Grade
FROM  Students s
FULL OUTER JOIN  Grades g 
ON s.StudentID = g.StudentID;

Result :
