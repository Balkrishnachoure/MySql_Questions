Q .Self Join:Retrieve the names of all employees and their managers from the "employees" table. Match employees to their managers using a self join.

Ans .A Self Join is a join in which a table is joined with itself. It is used to compare rows within the same table, treating it as if it were two separate tables. 
This is particularly useful when you need to relate rows to other rows within the same table, such as finding employees and their managers.

| 3          | Charlie      | NULL      |
| 4          | Dave         | 3         |
| 5          | Eve          | 1         |
