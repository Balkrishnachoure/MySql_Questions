2.Left Join:Display the names of all employees and their department names. If an employee does not belong to any department, display "No Department" instead, using a left join.

Ans : A Left Join returns all records from the left table (in this case, the employees table), along with the matched records from the right table (departments table). 
     If there is no match, the result will still include the left table's row, but the columns from the right table will be filled with NULL .
