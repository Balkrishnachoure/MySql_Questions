Order of Execution of Sql Queries :

In an SQL query, the logical processing order of the statements is as follows:

FROM clause: The data is retrieved from the specified table(s) in the FROM clause. 
WHERE clause: If there's a WHERE clause, the conditions specified are applied to filter the rows from the tables specified in the FROM clause. 
GROUP BY clause: If there's a GROUP BY clause, the rows are then grouped based on the specified columns. 
SELECT clause: The SELECT clause is applied to the grouped data, and any aggregate functions are calculated (such as COUNT in your case). 
ORDER BY clause: If there's an ORDER BY clause, the results are then sorted based on the specified columns.
